# Contributing to Cherry UI
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cherry UI! We welcome contributions from the community to help us build a robust and user-friendly React component library.

## Getting Started
* Fork the Repository: Start by forking the Cherry UI repository to your own GitHub account.
* Clone Your Fork: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
* Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name (e.g., feature/new-component or fix/button-issue).
* Install Dependencies: Run `npm install` (or yarn) to install the project's dependencies.
* Make Your Changes: Implement your feature or fix, following the code style and guidelines outlined below.
* Test Thoroughly: Ensure your changes don't introduce new issues by running the existing test suite and adding new tests if necessary.
* Commit Your Changes: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
* Push Your Branch: Push your branch to your forked repository.
* Open a Pull Request (PR): Submit a pull request to the main Cherry UI repository. Be sure to describe your changes and the problem they solve.
## Code Style and Guidelines
* Code Style: We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style. Run npm run lint and npm run format before committing.
* TypeScript: All components and utilities should be written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainability.
* Testing: We strive for high test coverage. Please include unit and/or integration tests with your contributions.
* Documentation: Keep documentation up-to-date. If you add a new component or feature, make sure to document it in the README and potentially the storybook.
* Accessibility: Ensure your components adhere to accessibility best practices (WAI-ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.).
## Types of Contributions
We welcome a variety of contributions, including:

* New Components: Propose and implement new components that fit the library's design principles.
* Bug Fixes: Help us identify and fix any issues in the existing components.
* Documentation: Improve documentation, tutorials, and examples.
* Tests: Add new tests to increase test coverage.
* Feature Enhancements: Suggest and implement improvements to existing components.
